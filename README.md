# Portfolio Website
![Heroku](https://pyheroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=my-portfolio-blog-website&style=plastic)

This is my first Portfolio Blog webpage. I'm using it to show off my latest projects and blogs.
If you like my page or some elements of it, feel free to fork and copy/adjust it after your needs.

This Page is still in development and should grow/expand together with my learning progress.

## Installation

After downloading the repository 'cd' into the directory.

Install the project with npm, run the following comand in your console:

```bash
  npm install 
```
    
To start the webpack dev server run:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

To compile the project with webpack run:

```bash
  npm run build
```

The dist folder will now hold the relevant files for deployment.

If compiled, you can run the static server application with:

```bash
  npm run start
```

Now you can test the project before deployment.
